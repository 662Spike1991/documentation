In this section, we will go over the support ticket feature, and how to write a support ticket, to help us resolve your issue faster.

## Ticket Support

The ticket support feature is available to certain Account packages and account types. For details, refer to the [support feature table above](#support-features-and-response-times). Tickets are associated with the site from which the ticket is opened. Please be sure that if you maintain several sites, that you open the ticket from the correct site's dashboard.

1. Create a support ticket from within the site's Dashboard by clicking **Support** > **Open Ticket**. This will automatically include the site and user information.

1. Choose the **ticket type**.

1. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).

1. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
   - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
   - When the issue began.
   - Error messages received, if applicable.
   - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

1. Click **Open Ticket**

Once a ticket is submitted, you can view details for your support requests. If are you are part of an organization, your support tickets are visible to all members except [Unprivileged users](/change-management#organizations-roles-and-permissions).


## Best Practices

### Open the Ticket in the Right Place

If you are a member of an [Organization](/organizations), use the Organization's Dashboard to visit the Support tab.

Contacting Support from your User Dashboard will not provide the same support level as a Site Dashboard owned by an Organization with a higher Account package. For a visual, check out the [Support Tab from the Organization Dashboard](#the-support-tab-from-the-organization-dashboard).

### Organization Dashboard Support Tab

If you are part of an Organization with an enhanced Account package, navigate to the Support tab from the Organization's Dashboard to make use of the Organization's Support level.

### One Ticket Per Issue

Opening multiple tickets on the same issue will only impede our ability to provide timely support. When opening a chat conversation to follow up on a discussion from a ticket, please let us know about the ticket so we can read up on what's already been discussed and attempted.

### Replication Steps

One of the first steps in troubleshooting is almost always to recreate the problem. Please provide us with the exact steps to replicate the issue. If we can't see it, we can't debug it.

### Specifics

Ambiguity is the kryptonite of good support. When discussing an issue, give us timestamps, error messages (in full), screenshots, URLs, and any other specific information that can help to identify problems.

### Custom Access

If your site uses nonstandard admin URLs, custom logins, etc., please let us know.

### Clarification

We're all real humans. We always try our best to understand the situation, but we may not always get it right the first time.

At the same time, our explanations or solutions might not always make sense to you. Don't be afraid to correct us (kindly), or to ask for clarification if we don't seem to understand the issue.
