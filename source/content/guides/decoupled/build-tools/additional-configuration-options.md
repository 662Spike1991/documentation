#### Using Other Git Hosts or CI Services

Terminus build tools supports a number of other combinations of Git hosts and CI services.

For example, to use GitHub actions as your CI service, you could add the following additional flag to your `terminus build:project:create` command:

```
--ci=githubactions
```

Other possible values include:

* `circleci`
* `gitlab-pipelines`
* `bitbucket-pipelines`

If you are using GitHub Actions, your token should have the "workflow" scope.

For more information, refer to the [Available Services](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin#available-services) section or the Build Tools [documentation](/guides/build-tools/). For a list of all available Build Tools command options, see the [Build Tools Project README](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin/blob/3.x/README.md#buildprojectcreate).

#### Using a GitHub Organization

If you would like the repo created to be under a GitHub organization instead of the authenticated user's namespace, you can use the `--org` option:

```
--org="{My Organization Name}"
```

For information on additional options, refer to the [Command Options](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin#command-options) section of the build tools documentation.
