[New Relic® Performance Monitoring](https://newrelic.com/) offers a wide array of metrics that provide a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application. New Relic® makes it easy for you to monitor your performance and speed up the support process by helping our support team visualize corresponding performance and symptoms.

On Pantheon, most plans come with free New Relic APM Pro, giving you code-level visibility into your website’s performance. Track releases, investigate query performance, and identify areas for improvement with the best-in-class software analytics tool suite.
