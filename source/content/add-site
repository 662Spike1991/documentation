## Adding a Site

## Migrating a Site

## Cloning a Site

### How do I clone an existing Pantheon site?

Drupal and WordPress sites can use Terminus to clone one Pantheon site to another from the command line. This method requires you to [install and authenticate Terminus](/terminus/install), then install the [Terminus Site Clone](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-site-clone-plugin) plugin.

Replace `<source>` and `<destination>` with target [site UUIDs](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#retrieve-the-site-uuis) or site names, and specify target development environment in place of `<env>` (dev or multidev):

```bash
terminus site:clone <source>.<env> <destination>.<env>
```

### How do I use the Pantheon Migrations plugin with a custom WordPress upstream?

If you'd like your existing WordPress site to get one-click updates from your [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream), then the migration process will be slightly different. The general process will be the same as a vanilla WordPress site with a few differences.

1. Click **Create New Site** instead of **Migrate existing site**.

1. Name your new site, and be sure to add it to the workspace with access to the Custom Upstream you want to use.

1. Choose your Custom Upstream and complete the installation.

You can now proceed with the [standard migration procedure](migrate), starting at Step 8.
