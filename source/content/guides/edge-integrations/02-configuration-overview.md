Overview bit here.

## Prerequisites

Your website must be connected to [Pantheon’s Advanced Global CDN](/guides/professional-services/advanced-global-cdn) (AGCDN) via the supported module and be assigned a required Terraform configuration for personalization features to work on your instance. Typically, this configuration is applied on a per-environment basis. This guide doesn’t cover Fastly setup and assumes that it’s already working and has been tested.

Edge Integrations setup for Drupal requires intermediate site-building skills. If you plan to extend the conditions beyond the ones that are provided by the modules, back-end Drupal module development skills are required. For WordPress, back-end WordPress development skills and familiarity with [WordPress hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/) (making use of existing [actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/)) is required.
