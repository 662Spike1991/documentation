All documentation repositories should adhere to a [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide). This document serves to define and detail the style conventions used in Pantheon's documentation.

You can also reference the [Pantheon Documentation Template](/doc-template) to see the common structure of our docs, or copy it to begin a new content piece.

Detailed style guidelines can be found in the [Google Developers Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/).  However, the guidelines in this document supersede the Google guidelines.
