This section provides information to help make managing content and tasks in your WordPress site easier. 

## Content Staging

Review our [Content Staging](/content-staging) doc to learn how to successfully stage and move content between environments in your WordPress site.

## Cron for WordPress

Review our [Cron for WordPress](/wordpress-cron) doc to learn how to create and run jobs using Pantheon Cron or WordPress's WP-Cron feature on your Pantheon site.

## WordPress Multisite

Review our [WordPress Multisite](/guides/multisite/) guide to learn how Pantheon supports [WordPress Site Networks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/) (also known as WordPress Multisite) which lets you create a network of sites using a single copy of the WordPress codebase and a common database. For those responsible for maintaining several or dozens of similar sites, WordPress Site Networks can make it much easier to fix bugs and deploy new features across all of those sites.
