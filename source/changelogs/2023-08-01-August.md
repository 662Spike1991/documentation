## Platform Updates
### Solr Search for WordPress 2.5.0 Update
We released an update for the [Solr Search for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/solr-power/) which disables auto-commit by default and allows cron to push solr commits regularly instead.

This drastically improves the performance of large sites and avoids 503 errors related to hard committing on every update. This update is recommended for all WordPress sites currently running the plugin.

You can still enable auto-commit by explicitly setting `SOLRPOWER_DISABLE_AUTOCOMMIT` to `false`.


### WordPress and Drupal 7 PHP Default Version Updates
This update bumps the default PHP version to 8.1. We will continue to support sites running PHP 7.4 despite its EOL status (see https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).

Please test your site thoroughly before deploying this update to your live site. If your site requires an older version of PHP or if you'd like to upgrade to PHP 8.2, please see https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/php/php-versions for more information on using pantheon.yml to set your PHP version.
