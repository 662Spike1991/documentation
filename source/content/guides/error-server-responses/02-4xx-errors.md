This section provides information on how to resolve 4xx errors.

### Pantheon 401 Unauthorized

This is the default response of an HTTP Basic Auth failure after a site administrator has [locked the site's environment](/guides/secure-development/security-tool). This is usually not a platform failure, as environment access can be set from the Dashboard Security tab.

In some circumstances, a 401 can be triggered inadvertently if a site environment is locked, and a user passes the HTTP auth but the site sends a 401 HTTP status code. The workaround is to disable HTTP auth security for the environment in question.

### Pantheon 403 Forbidden
"Access denied to uploaded PHP files." This message is shown when a PHP file is attempted to be accessed in Valhalla, Pantheon's network file system.

Pantheon also prevents public access via the web server to private files, `.htaccess`, and directory listings.

### Pantheon 404 Unknown Site
"The hostname ... is unknown. Please double-check that this is the right URL. If so, make sure it matches your Dashboard's custom domain settings." This typically is shown when there is an internal routing problem or a site environment does not exist.

### Error 404 Not Found
"Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()" or a similar error message displays when a web browser cannot find the element specified.

This error occurs when the client (via web browser) successfully connects to the host (websiteâ€™s application server), but is unable to find the actual resource requested (for example, a specific URL or file name). We recommend confirming that the URL or file name is correct and still exists on the site.
