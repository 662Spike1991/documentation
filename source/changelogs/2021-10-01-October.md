Drupal 9.2.x will receive security coverage until June 15, 2022. Sites on 9.1.x or earlier should update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.11).

## Documentation

[Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) - The Autopilot updater bot now scans a site’s homepage when initially enabled and automatically suggest 10 links that are important for VRT, allowing users to enable it for large site portfolios without having to manually create a test plan. You can also use the CMS update automation tool in the Dashboard to determine the estimated time your team has saved in Autopilot. For more information, refer to our [Autopilot documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/autopilot/enable-autopilot/#enable-autopilot).

[Pantheon Global CDN](https://pantheon.io/docs/global-cdn)- The Global CDN now offers Experience Protection to provide continous and uninterrupted site uptime. If your site experieneces issues, whether it’s an infrastructure problem or an application error, the Global CDN now delivers cached content to visitors instead of displaying an error message. For more information, refer to our [Experienece Protection documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/global-cdn#experience-protection).
