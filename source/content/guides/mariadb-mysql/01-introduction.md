Pantheon provides direct access for your MySQLÂ databases, both for debugging and for importing large databases. Each site environment (Dev, Test and Live) has a separate database that requires different credentials for each environment. The credentials are automatically included in your site configuration.

This guide shows you how to:

- Access your MySQL database through Pantheon's direct connection tool MariaDB

- Access your MySQL database with Workbench

- Resolve slow logs

- Identify and kill long-running MySQL queries
