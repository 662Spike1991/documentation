## Feature and Product Release Updates

### Integrated Composer Update

Pantheon customers can now re-run [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) builds via Terminus - without creating a new commit. Previously, pushing a new commit to the Dashboard was the only way to trigger a build. Occasionally site developers experience failed builds for external reasons (external repo issue, broken key, etc.). This update brings even greater functionality and flexibility to Integrated Composer.
