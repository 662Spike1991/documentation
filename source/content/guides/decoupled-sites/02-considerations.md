The following components are needed for Pantheon Decoupled: 

* NodeJS
    We recommend installing NVM using Homebrew if you are using a Mac

* Lando

Install the latest release of Lando. Lando ships with a recommended version of Docker Desktop if you do not already have it installed.

Recommended:

VS Code - Other IDEs can be used, but our projects ship with suggested plugins an example settings for VSCode.

Optional - These tools are all included in the Lando VM, but can be useful to have installed for use without Lando.

PHP - we recommend installing via homebrew on Mac to not conflict with the OS PHP version.

Composer - follow instructions to install composer globally.
