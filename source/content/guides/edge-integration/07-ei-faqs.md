Titlecase!

## How can my site implement personalization in a way that doesn’t violate the GDPR or other legal frameworks?



## How should different Edge Integrations respond to the Do Not Track Header?



## How can I test my changes in newly created Multidev if the AGCDN parts require a custom domain name and/or manual work from Pantheon to enable? How does Pantheon’s answer change when AGCDN moves “behind” GCDN?


 
## In a time before Pantheon announces this stuff, when some Composer-dependencies repos are likely private, will Pantheon’s Integrated Composer tool work?



## Can I have Autopilot test against different variants? Can Autopilot trigger different geographical conditions?



## Is there anything special I need to do with Localdev or Lando to enable local development of Edge Integrations functionality



## Is there anything I can do if I know certain traffic is coming through a geographic location (like VPNing through Toronto) but Fastly still categorizes it incorrectly?



## How is Pantheon handling backwards a compatibility of the intersecting libraries/packages/modules/plugins and its proprietary platform? Which pieces respect SemVer? When should breaking changes be expected?
