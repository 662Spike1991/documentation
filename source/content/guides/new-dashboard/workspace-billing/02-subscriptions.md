Navigate to the Billing page from your Personal Workspace to manage invoices, site subscriptions, and payment methods available to your user.

The information available through the Personal Workspace Billing page differs from billing information in an Organization's Workspace. To manage billing for an Organization's Workspace, you will be directed to the Legacy Dashboard.

## Billing

When there is no current payment method associated with your user, Personal Workspace Billing opens to the [Payment Methods](#payment-methods) screen.

If a payment method is associated with a site subscription, sites will be listed in the [Site Subscriptions](#site-subscriptions) table.


## Subscriptions

The Subscriptions page catalogs your access to sites in your Personal Workspace and the payment methods used.

Subscriptions can be sorted by the following information:

* Site name
* Site plan
* Billing cadence
* Cost
* Payment method

### Account Subscription

The account tier and cost is displayed on the Subscriptions page. You can manage and view updates to the Personal Workspace account tier.

### Site Subscriptions

By default, Sites are listed by name. You can sort according to your preference. For more inforation on a site in you Personal Workspace, you can click the site name in the Subscriptions table or navigate to the **Sites** tab. Additionally, you can filter Sites by site plan or payment method.


### Change Site Plan

You can upgrade and change site plans. Upgrades will change your site's resources and access to features immediately. The card associated with your site will be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing period. 

Site plan downgrades will change your site's resources and access to features immediately. Beginning on the next billing cycle, the associated card will be charged for the new site plan. No prorated refunds or credits will be issued for site downgrades.


### Change Billing Cadence

You can switch to annual billing from a monthly cadence. Access the [Site Billing](/site-billing) tab of the Dashboard, to transfer Site ownership and payment responsibility.


#### Roles & Permissions

The permission to manage a site's plan is granted only to the roles of **Site Owner** / **Organization Administrator**. Other roles do not have access to change the site plan as described on this page. For details, see [Role-Based Permissions & Change Management](/change-management/#site-level-roles-and-permissions).

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

If you need to assume site and billing ownership, the current Site Owner must [transfer it to you directly](/site-billing#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site).
