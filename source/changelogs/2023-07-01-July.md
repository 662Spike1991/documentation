## Platform Updates

### Drupal 7.98

[Drupal 7.98](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.98) is available on the Pantheon platform. Users may update their sites immediately. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates).

## Feature and Product Release Updates

### Integrated Composer Update

Pantheon customers can now re-run [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) builds via Terminus - without creating a new commit. Previously, pushing a new commit to the Dashboard was the only way to trigger a build. Occasionally site developers experience failed builds for external reasons (external repo issue, broken key, etc.). This update brings even greater functionality and flexibility to Integrated Composer.
