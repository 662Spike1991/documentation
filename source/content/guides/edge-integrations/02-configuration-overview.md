Overview bit here.

## Prerequisites

Your Drupal website must be connected to [Pantheon’s Advanced Global CDN](/guides/professional-services/advanced-global-cdn) (AGCDN) via the supported module and be assigned a required Terraform configuration for personalization features to work on your instance. Typically, this configuration is applied on a per-environment basis. This guide doesn’t cover Fastly setup and assumes that it’s already working and has been tested.

The setup requires intermediate site-building skills. If you plan to extend the conditions beyond the ones that are provided by the modules, back-end Drupal module development skills are required.
