Pantheon is a WebOps platform that provides the speed and performance needed to keep your WordPress website running smoothly. Pantheon uses a container-based infrastructure that provides streamlined provisioning, high availability, smooth scaling, and increased security.

## WordPress on Pantheon

You can create a new WordPress site from scratch on Pantheon or migrate an existing WordPress site to the Pantheon platform. The Pantheon migration tool walks you through the process of installing a plugin on your existing site, and completing the steps to transfer the site to Pantheon. 

## Site Management

You can edit your site directly on Pantheon using SFTP or Git. This includes  managing themes, plugins, content, and database files. All changes are tracked in version control, and your files and databases will automatically be backed up.

You can also use power tools such as [Terminus](/terminus) to manage your Pantheon WordPress site from the command line, or [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) to use available platform hooks. 

We will cover advanced examples later in this guide, including: 

- Terminus build tools plugin

- Advanced WordPress on Pantheon

- Integrating external Git repositories

- Continuous integration

- WordPress with Composer

- Automated testing with Pantheon for teams requiring complex workflows and automation
