If you are on the Platinum or Diamond package, you have access to Custom Scheduling. This functionality allows you to schedule Autopilot to run on a more specific cadence. For example, on a particular day of the week, or day of the month.

To update your settings, navigate to your site's **Configuration** tab, scroll down to the **Destination & Frequency** section, and select **Custom** under the **Update Frequency** section.

<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

Please note that the day you select for Autopilot to run is when updates will **start** running, and does not mean the update will be complete on that day. For best results, schedule Autopilot to run the day before you plan to review test results.

**Updates are run in the UTC time zone.**
