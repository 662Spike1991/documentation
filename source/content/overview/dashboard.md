<Tab title="Overview" id="overview" active={true}>

Easily visualize and manage sites, users, traffic, metrics, visual regression testing (VRT), and everything else needed to keep your WebOps experience smooth and uneventful.

Our workspaces and dashboards provide a real-time interface into Pantheon. It includes everything you need to build, launch, and run sites. Create new projects, manage team access, interface via SFTP or Git (version control), and track miscellaneous tools like backups. It also allows you to deploy and scale your sites.
