This section provides answers to frequently asked Global CDN questions.

### I already have a CDN. Can I use it with the Pantheon Global CDN?

Yes, but because it adds additional complexity, we suggest you only do so if you identify a need that the Pantheon Global CDN doesn't address.

To retain your existing CDN, set up a "stacked CDN" configuration. Ensure that you are enforcing HTTPS only at the outer CDN and are assuming HTTPS in the application. Check your CDN for how to redirect all traffic to HTTPS.

While we have some limited documentation for this setup with [Cloudflare](/cloudflare#option-2-use-cloudflares-cdn-stacked-on-top-of-pantheons-global-cdn), this is a largely self-serve practice.

If you need additional features or customization for your CDN, consider our [Advanced Global CDN](/guides/professional-services/advanced-global-cdn) service.

### Is the www-redirector service still available?

No, the www-redirector service is part of the legacy infrastructure. You can choose your primary domain and redirect all traffic to HTTPS by adding [301 redirects](/guides/launch/redirects) to your site's configuration file (wp-config.php or settings.php).

### Are vanity domains supported?

You can upgrade a site to Global CDN that is using [vanity domains](/vanity-domains), but HTTPS will not be provisioned for the vanity domains. Only custom domains will have HTTPS provisioned.

### What about Cloudflare?

See [Cloudflare Domain Configuration](/cloudflare).

### Is the CDN configurable?

No, we pre-configured the CDN so you donâ€™t have to hassle with configuration, and we can guarantee performance and uptime. The Global CDN's behavior is the same as our legacy cache which is heavily optimized for Drupal and WordPress sites, and serves billions of pages monthly, except it's globally distributed.

### Do I get access to hit rates or other statistics?

Hit rates are not currently available, but you can measure traffic for the Live environment. For details, see [Metrics in the Site Dashboard](/metrics).

### Can I use my own Fastly account with the Pantheon Global CDN?

You can, but as mentioned above you should identify a need for adding additional complexity first. If you're using Fastly TLS services with WordPress, you'll want to check for the `HTTP_FASTLY_SSL` header so that WordPress can build URLs to your CSS and JS assets correctly. Do this by adding the following to `wp-config.php`:

```php:title=wp-config.php
if (!empty( $_SERVER['HTTP_FASTLY_SSL'])) {
  $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
}
```

### Can I expose the `Surrogate-Key-Raw` header?

Yes! Expose `Surrogate-Key-Raw` by including `Pantheon-Debug:1` in a curl request, then use `grep` to filter the output. Replace `https://www.example.com/` in the following example:

```bash{promptUser: user}
curl -IsH "Pantheon-Debug:1" https://www.example.com/ | grep surrogate-key-raw
```

![curl -IsH "Pantheon-Debug:1" https://www.scalewp.io/ | grep surrogate-key-raw](../images/surrogate-key-raw-example.png)

To prevent issues with Twitter card validation and to reduce the overall time to load, the `Surrogate-Key-Raw` header is not returned by default. Exposing this header provides context for entities included on a given page.
