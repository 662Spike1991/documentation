## What Is Edge Integrations?

Edge Integrations is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows users to personalize WordPress and Drupal. It is a modern approach to audience-based content personalization which presents an alternative to most personalization engines. Our approach leverages tight integration between the CMS and our Global CDN with Edge Computing capabilities to deliver the right content to the right audience directly, with fewer moving parts. Rather than a painful "crawl, walk, run" process, you can skip straight to walking in 90 days or less.

### How does Edge Integrations work?



## Benefits of Edge Integrations/Is Edge Integrations Right for You?

- Unified Experience
	- You can improve productivity by using existing content, style guides, media, and CMS integrations. No need to manage assets in multiple places.

- Performance-forward
	- Improve credibility with a fast, seamless customer experience- distribute personalized content across dozens of global and US points of presence.

- Cost-effective
	- Increase business impact by instrumenting and measuring success with your current analytics products. No need for new segmentation tooling.

- Geographic targeting
	- Based on the location of the visitor, the site will deliver a different homepage here for Canadian visitors vs US (Poutine vs Pizza).

- Interest fingerprinting
	- Repeated engagement with types of content — e.g. looking at multiple vegan recipes — will put a visitor in an interest cohort, which will  reorganize the recipes landing page.

There are many more potential ways to leverage content variation to identify valuable audience segments or variants. Our approach is to focus on getting immediate lift for existing sites, and building from there.
