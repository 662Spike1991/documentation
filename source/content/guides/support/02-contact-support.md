## Real Time Chat Support

Start a chat with our Support Team to ask questions or request assistance on issues within our [scope of support](#scope-of-support). This support feature is available to all users and sites across all plans, including Sandbox.

To receive the highest level of support available to your site or organization, remember to access the chat from the Organization Dashboard if available.

1. From your Site or User Dashboard, click **Support**.

1. Click **Launch Chat**, then click **New Conversation**.

1. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
   - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
   - When the issue began.
   - Error messages received, if applicable.
   - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

You can download a transcript of your chat with the <em class="fa fa-arrow-down" style="text-decoration: underline;"></em> button:

Some in-browser ad or tracking blockers can interfere with the **Launch Chat** button. If you don't see it, try allowlisting `pantheon.io` or disabling the browser extension. Intercom has posted more details on [why this happens](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/1200-why-am-i-missing-users-that-are-showing-up-on-my-own-system) on their site.
