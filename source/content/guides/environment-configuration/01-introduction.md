Each site on Pantheon comes with three environments: Dev, Test, and Live. This allows you to develop and test features without impacting your Live site. Additional development environments are available with [Multidev](/guides/multidev). Refer to the [Pantheon WebOps Workflow](/pantheon-workflow) documentation for more details.

The separation of configuration and code also helps improve security and makes it easy to restore an individual environment to a backup version.

This guide shows you how to:

- Read environment configuration

- Install an indicator to receive updates on your Pantheon site and environments

- Restore an environment

- Configure WordPress-specific environments and Drupal 9-specific environments
