This section provides detailed information all AGCDN and AGCDN with WAFand IO features.


## AGCDN Features

### OSI Layer 3 and 4 DDoS Protection & Mitigation

Advanced Global CDN provides <abbr title="Distributed Denial of Service">DDoS</abbr> protection and mitigation at the network (Layer 3) and transport (Layer 4) layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).

### SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance

SOC 2<Popover title="SOC" content="System and Organization Controls (SOC) is a suite of audit reports defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)." /> Type 2 compliance provides third-party assurance to our customers about the conformance of Pantheonâ€™s information security system with industry standards. Our SOC 2 compliance covers the Security and Availability [Trust Services Criteria](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/trustdataintegritytaskforce.html).

### IP Allowlisting and Blocklisting

Restrict access to properties using Access Control Lists (ACLs) that use IP addresses to either allow or deny access.

- Blocklist - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.

- Allowlist - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.

### Token Authentication with JSON Web Token

Use AGCDN Edge to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT)<Popover title="JSON Web Tokens" content="A JSON Web Tokens is an Internet standard for creating compact, encrypted JSON-based access tokens that assert some number of claims, such as 'logged in as admin'." /> to help build your custom API.

### Custom Error and Maintenance Page Rules

Response code messages enable you to create custom error pages (for example, 404 and 503 errors) for a tailored end-user experience.

### Geolocation-based Actions

Sending location info to your application is much faster than fetching it from a third-party API. AGCDN enables actions based on the physical location of your user (for example, blocking or redirecting based on country), and can send location information to your application for performant, custom control.

### Device Detection and Edge Control

[Device detection](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/delivering-different-content-to-different-devices) can drive differentiated delivery strategies at the edge of the network to address issues that impact mobile user experience.

### Complete CDN Edge Logs

Edge Logs show every request to your website and records of whether or not the content was cached. Server logs can only record requests that couldn't be fulfilled from a CDN's cache. Full CDN edge logs replace these with logs to provide a complete picture of your traffic.

### Modify and Filter Headers at the Edge

Change or filter request and response headers before your application goes live. You can create, add, delete, or update parts of your request and apply custom rules.

### Edge Redirects

Reduce requests to your CMS by moving page redirects to the edge. We can do path, domain, and pattern-based (RegEx) redirects, or redirects based on geolocation information. We can also combine redirect behavior using Headers (Cookies, Responses, etc.).

### Domain Masking and Reverse Proxy

Domain masking runs multiple Pantheon or non-Pantheon applications behind a single domain, using different URL paths. Reverse proxy serves content from another service (for example, Amazon S3) seamlessly from your application.

### Enterprise Blue and Green Deployment Support

Support for blue/green deployment<Popover title="Blue/Green Deployment" content="With a blue/green deployment strategy, the new version of your application is released alongside the current version. After you conduct appropriate tests, traffic is switched to the new version." /> CI/CD processes that enable continuous testing and deployment workflows and disaster recovery.

## AGCDN with WAF and IO Features

### Layer 7 and Enterprise WAF Rules

Application-layer (OSI Layer 7) protection simplifies event monitoring and mitigation without requiring changes that introduce latency.

Our Web Application Firewall (**WAF**) inspects each packet in detail to block malicious traffic and is fine-tuned for WordPress and Drupal.

Support for <abbr title="Open Web Application Security Project">OWASP</abbr> WordPress and Drupal rules help you monitor and address the most common application risks. Examples include SQL injection and <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> vulnerabilities.

### Efficient Image Optimization at the Edge

Image Optimization (IO) renders images using high-density points of presence (POPs) that cache content for longer times and serve millions of image variations. Serving from the edge in this way offloads work from your servers and improves your site's performance. IO supports several formats, including animated GIFs.

### Advanced Bot Detection and Mitigation 

The following third-party plugins are available:
  
- [Shape Log Analysis](https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/How-to-Setup-Shape-Log-Analysis-in-Fastly?page=1)

- [DataDome](https://docs.datadome.co/docs/module-fastly)

- [PerimeterX](https://www.fastly.com/products/cloud-security/bot-detection)

The customer is responsible for purchasing, maintaining payment for, and supporting these plugins.

### Rate Limiting 

Rate Limiting is in early access. This is feature of Advanced Global CDN that lets you place limits on request volume at the network perimeter. Organizations of all sizes can adopt this edge configuration to block malicious traffic. Rate Limiting can be configured to guard critical assets including login, form, and promotional pages by adding another layer of security to your site.

The benefits of Rate Limiting include:

- **Volumetric Attack Mitigation** - Reduce the effectiveness of malicious traffic, including brute-force login and denial-of-service attacks.

- **Policy-based Control** - Adjust configurations for your policy, including requests per second, and detection window.

- **Custom Responses** - Select from actions that allow you to block requests or log them, and configure custom responses for your policy.

<Alert title="Note"  type="info" >

This feature is currently in Early Access. Reach out to your account manager for more information.
