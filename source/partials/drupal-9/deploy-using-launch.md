You should now have all three of the major components of your site imported into Pantheon. Clear your caches in the [Pantheon Dashboard](/clear-caches#pantheon-dashboard) or with terminus like so:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus drush $SITE.dev cr
  ```

Review the site, then proceed to launch using the [Launch Essentials](/guides/launch) documentation.
