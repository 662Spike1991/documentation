<Tab title="Overview" id="overview" active={true}>

A content delivery network (CDN) like Pantheon's Global CDN can help by routing requests to the nearest Point of Presence (POP) for faster data delivery. With coverage around the globe, your site's content can be delivered quickly to your visitors, no matter where they're located. By being closer to your visitors and their browsers, you can ensure that they have a fast and seamless experience on your site.
