Front-End Sites on Pantheon allows you to use [decoupled architecture](/guides/decoupled/overview/#what-is-a-decoupled-site) to separate your frontend and backend into distinct entities.

You can use a frontend starter kit to streamline the creation of your Front-End site on Pantheon. Available Drupal frontend starters are:

- Next.js + Drupal

## Why Use The Next.js Drupal Starter?

The `next-drupal-starter` is designed as a starting point to for a Next.js site that consumes data from a Drupal backend configured with the [`pantheon_decoupled` module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_decoupled) installed.

The starter has a dependency on the `@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit`. The starter kit includes helpers that maximize available Drupal backend features.
