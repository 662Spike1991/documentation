<Tab title="Overview" id="overview" active={true}>

As site numbers grow and demands become more diverse, the choice between enforcing standards and allowing individual sites flexibility to meet unique goals can become a real struggle. Custom Upstreams allow control over site standards, while still allowing customization when needed, all without introducing any single points of failure.

Custom Upstreams act as a scaffold for new sites, allowing developers and site owners of any skill level to kickoff projects at warp speed.

Instead of repeating the same technical work on each individual site, you can build and maintain a common user interface with unified branding and functionality once, in a single source.
