If you'd like your existing WordPress site to get one-click updates from your [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream), then the migration process will be slightly different. The general process will be the same as a vanilla WordPress site with a few differences.

1. Click **Create New Site** instead of **Migrate existing site**.

1. Name your new site, and be sure to add it to the workspace with access to the Custom Upstream you want to use.

1. Choose your Custom Upstream and complete the installation.

You can now proceed with the [standard migration procedure](migrate), starting at Step 8.
