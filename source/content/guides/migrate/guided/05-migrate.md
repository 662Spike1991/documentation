Pantheon provides a guided path for migrating existing sites to the platform. This process begins by clicking **Migrate Existing Site**.

<Partial file="migrate/migrate-all.md" />

You now have a Dev environment containing your migrated site, including your Content Management System (accessible via the **Site Admin** button).  

If you want to create your Test and Live environments, refer to the relevant sections in [Create a New CMS Site](/add-site-dashboard).

Review [Troubleshooting](/guides/guided/troubleshooting) or [contact Support](/guides/support/contact-support/) if the migration is unsuccessful. Include a link to the Site Dashboard and any details you can provide, such as where you are migrating the site from.
