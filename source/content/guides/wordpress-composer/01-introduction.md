[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a widely-used PHP dependency and package manager that provides an alternative, more modern way to manage the external (non-core) code used by a WordPress or Drupal site.

At the most basic level, Composer requires:

- A list of dependencies
- A place to put the dependencies

## First Steps

Complete the steps below before using this guide to create, migrate, or manage updates on your Composer-managed site.

1. Review [Composer's own documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) to understand how Composer can be used independently of WordPress.

1. Review [Composer Fundamentals Dependencies](/guides/composer#dependencies).

1. Review [Managing Core as Project Dependency](/guides/composer#managing-core-as-a-project-dependency).

1. Review [Custom Upstream Workflow](/guides/composer#custom-upstream-workflow).
