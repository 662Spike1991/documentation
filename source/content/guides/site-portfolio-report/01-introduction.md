The Site Portfolio Report provides supplemental information to help you understand and audit the charges in your invoice. Pantheon’s invoice notification generates and emails the Site Portfolio Report along with a link to the online invoice for contract customers with an active contract. 

The Site Owner of the account will receive the Site Portfolio Report by email through:

- Routine periodic invoicing (yearly or as per contract terms)

- Mid-year invoicing for existing sites with automatic upgrades

- Requests for invoicing submitted to Pantheon

The Site Portfolio Report provides important account information at the top of the page:

- **Invoice Number**: click this link to view your current invoice.

- **Current Invoice Date**: this is the date of the current invoice and is not linked to any other information.

## What’s in the Site Portfolio Report

The Site Portfolio Report provides a snapshot of your portfolio through three charts:

### Existing Sites with Automatic Upgrades

Automatic upgrades happen when your sites exceed the traffic limits of the plan you selected in your contract. Pantheon will upgrade your plan to cover the increased traffic from your users.

Read [Traffic Limits and Overages](/traffic-limits) for more information on how Pantheon applies site traffic measurements to sites.

### New Sites that Exceeded the Contract

Pantheon allows you to add sites to your portfolio as needed, regardless of the allotment you previously paid for in your contract to ensure that visitors to your site are not blocked. The charges listed in this section of your Site Portfolio Report can result from multiple scenarios, including:

- Your site portfolio was expanded by the creation of one or more sites

- Your site(s) received an upgrade, initiated by you or by automatic performance adjustments

### All Active Sites in Portfolio

This information provides a snapshot of the active sites in your portfolio, including now-deleted sites that were active the last time the invoice was generated. This information does not show deleted, inactive, or sandbox sites.
