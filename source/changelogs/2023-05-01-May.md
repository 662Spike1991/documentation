## Feature and Product Release Updates

### Cache Hit Ratio Metrics

Cache Hit Ratio data is now available on the site Dashboard under the Live Environment's Metrics tab. A site's Cache Hit Ratio measures how efficiently the Global CDN is being leveraged to give users the fastest response time vs using a site's resources to process requests. This information has also been added to Terminus `env:metrics` [command](/terminus/commands/env-metrics).

### TLS Cipher Suites Updates

In continual efforts to keep Pantheon customer sites safe and secure, Pantheon has removed support for the following TLS Ciphersuites at the Global CDN:

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

Pantheon also added a strong cipher to our supported cipher list:

- ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
