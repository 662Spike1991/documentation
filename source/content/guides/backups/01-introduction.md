You can manage all of your site's backup details in the Backups tab. Each backup contains three components:

- **Code:** anything version controlled and committed via the Site Dashboard. Uncommitted SFTP changes to code are not backed up.
- **Database:** a `mysqldump` of your site's db.
- **Files:** images and assets stored in the standard upload path `wp-content/uploads` for WordPress and `sites/all/default/files` for Drupal. Various content generated by your application is not backed up. For example, generated images from image styles and aggregated CSS and JS assets, are not backed up.



## Backup Schedule and Retention

**Paid sites:** You can enable or disable automatic backups. If enabled, your nightly backup is stored for a week and your weekly backup is stored for a month. You can select the day the weekly backup is run:

Daily backups are scheduled automatically.

**All sites:** You can run manual backups for free, and choose to keep them for one month or six months.
