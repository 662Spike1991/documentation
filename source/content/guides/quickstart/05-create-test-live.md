Now let's create our Test site and our Live site.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

If you haven’t completed the installation of your Dev site, return to [Create New Site](/guides/quickstart/create-new-site), and complete the installation before proceeding with the rest of this guide.

</Alert>

## Create Test Environment

1. Go to your Site Dashboard and click the <Icon icon="equalizer" text="Test"/> tab. Here you’ll have access to your Test environment, but it hasn’t been created yet. Click **Initialize Test Environment** to create one.

  This takes a few moments.

1. Now click <Icon icon="new-window-alt" text="Visit Test Site"/>. This will open your Test site in a new browser tab with the URL `test-YOURSITE.pantheonsite.io`.

## Create Live Environment

1. Go back to your Site Dashboard, and click the <Icon icon="cardio" text="Live"/> tab. Here you’ll have access to your Live environment, but it hasn’t been created yet. Click **Initialize Live Environment** to create the environment.

1. Once the environment is initialized, click **Workflows** <Icon icon="chevron-down" /> (in the header area, on the right). In the dropdown you’ll find your active workflow as well as the workflows we’ve completed to this point.

Congratulations! You now have three copies of your site running in three separate environments: Dev, Test, and Live.
