## Platform Updates

### Drupal 7.98

[Drupal 7.98](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.98) is available on the Pantheon platform. Users may update their sites immediately. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates).

### WP-CLI 2.8.1

[WP-CLI 2.8.1](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2023/06/05/wp-cli-v2-8-1-release-notes/) is now live on the platform.

## Feature and Product Release Updates

### Integrated Composer

Pantheon customers can now re-run [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer) builds via Terminus - without creating a new commit. Previously, pushing a new commit to the Dashboard was the only way to trigger a build. Occasionally site developers experience failed builds for external reasons (external repo issue, broken key, etc.). This update brings even greater functionality and flexibility to Integrated Composer.

## Community
