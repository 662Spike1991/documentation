EA Words

## What is it?

EA is product release (in a few months/next year); can try out certain features of product before it's brought to Limited Availablity, if anything goes awry, we can't help you, because it's not supported. Docs in Confluence, no public facing docs. Up to CSM on how to disseminate info.

LA- gets public facing docs

GA- remove banner and everyone can use and point to support doc

## How do I get support for it?

Pantheon does not have a scope of support for EA products. Have resources in place to have questions answered- community slack, office hours

in your journey from EA to LA
