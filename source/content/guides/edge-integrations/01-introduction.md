## What Is Edge Integrations?

Edge Integrations is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows users to personalize WordPress and Drupal. It is a modern approach to audience-based content personalization which presents an alternative to most personalization engines. Pantheon's approach leverages tight integration between the CMS and our Global CDN with Edge Computing capabilities to deliver the right content to the right audience directly, and with fewer moving parts. 

### How does Edge Integrations work?

Edge Integrations uses configuration at the "edge" or the CDN to enable personalization options for Geolocation or Interests. This is done by using [HTTP vary headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary) that tell the CDN return cached variations of content based on values identified by the user browsing the site.

## Is Edge Integrations Right for You?

The benefits of Edge Integrations:

- Unified Experience
	- You can improve productivity by using existing content, style guides, media, and CMS integrations. No need to manage assets in multiple places.

- Performance-forward
	- Improve credibility with a fast, seamless customer experience- distribute personalized content across dozens of global and US points of presence.

- Cost-effective
	- Increase business impact by instrumenting and measuring success with your current analytics products. No need for new segmentation tooling.

- Geographic targeting
	- Based on the location of the visitor, the site will deliver a different homepage here for Canadian visitors vs US (Poutine vs Pizza).

- Interest fingerprinting
	- Repeated engagement with types of content — e.g. looking at multiple vegan recipes — will put a visitor in an interest cohort, which will  reorganize the recipes landing page.

There are many more potential ways to leverage content variation to identify valuable audience segments or variants. Pantheon's focus is to focus get immediate lift for existing sites, and build from there.
