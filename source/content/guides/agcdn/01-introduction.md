[<dfn id="agcdn">Advanced Global CDN</dfn>](https://pantheon.io/product/advanced-global-cdn?docs) is a Managed Service that takes Pantheon's <abbr title="Content delivery network">CDN</abbr> offering a step forward, for customers that require unique optimizations for digital delivery at scale.

Each AGCDN service configuration is offered as an annual contract subscription. Customers can include multiple sites to the configuration, or conditionally apply specific rules.

It includes a wide range of benefits that let teams individually manage their own sites, drive growth through site iteration, calibrate control over branding, and extend enterprise-grade security.

> **Note**: At the moment, AGCDN only works with custom domains. `.pantheonsite.io` domains are not covered.
