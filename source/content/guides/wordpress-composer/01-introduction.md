[<dfn id="composer">Composer</dfn>](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) is a widely-used PHP dependency and package manager that provides an alternative, more modern way to manage the external (non-core) code used by a WordPress or Drupal site.

At the most basic level, Composer requires:

- A list of dependencies
- A place to put the dependencies
