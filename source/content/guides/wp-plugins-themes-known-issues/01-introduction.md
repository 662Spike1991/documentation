This guide provides important information WordPress plugins and themes. Specifically, this guide provides:

- Assumed write access information for WordPress plugins and themes
- WordPress themes with known issues and recommended workarounds
- An A to Z directory of WordPress plugins with known issues and recommended workarounds


This guide includes WordPress plugins, themes, and functions that may not function as expected or are currently problematic on the Pantheon platform. This is not a comprehensive list (refer to [other issues](#other-issues)). We continually update it as problems are reported and/or solved. If you are aware of any modules or plugins that do not work as expected, please [contact support](/guides/support/contact-support/).

We do not prevent you from installing and using these plugins or themes. However, we cannot provide support for incompatible plugins and themes, or if they are used against the guidance provided here.
