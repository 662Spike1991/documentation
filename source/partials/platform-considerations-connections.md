### Platform Considerations

Due to the nature of the platform, connections will change from time to time. Because of the use of ProxySQL, it is not possible to obtain credentials using the `$_ENV` superglobal inside PHP applications. In this instance, you should use a Bash script and Terminus connection. Please refer to the [Create Secure Connection to MySQL using TLS](/ssh-tunnels#create-secure-connection-to-mysql-using-tls) documentation to do so.
